Anomaly detection on Hypothyroidism dataset

Hypothyroidism happens when your thyroid doesnâ€™t create and release enough thyroid hormone into your body. This makes your metabolism slow down, affecting your entire body. Also known as underactive thyroid disease, hypothyroidism is fairly common.
When your thyroid levels are extremely low, this is called myxedema.
This severe type of hypothyroidism is life-threatening.
In general, hypothyroidism is a very treatable condition but 
it can actually be difficult to diagnose it because the symptoms can be easily confused with other.

For this reason we propose an anomaly detection system that by leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, it's able to uncover atypical patterns that may signify potential hypothyroidism cases, thus enabling earlier diagnosis and intervention.

The project is divided into two primary components: comprehensive dataset exploration and the application of multiple anomaly detection methods.
